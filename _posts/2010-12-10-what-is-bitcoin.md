title: What Is Bitcoin
description: What Is Bitcoin
---

<p>A form of <a href="/blog/">currency which is digital</a>, Bitcoin is held and created electronically. No one is a master of it. It isn’t printed, similar to dollars and euros – people generate it as well as business that operate computers across the world, in the usage of software that enables to solve problems mathematically. </p>

<p>It is the earliest example of cryptocurrency, a developing money category.</p>

<h2>What is its difference with the normal currencies?</h2>

<p>Bitcoin can be used in purchasing things electronically, making it similar to conventional money like euros, yen or dollars which are also digitally traded. </p>

<p>But Bitcoin being distinctive to conventional money is decentralized, which is considered an important characteristic of it. No single institution is a master of the bitcoin network, making people at ease since it means that giant banks can’t possibly control their money. </p>

<h2>Who created it?</h2>

<p>Bitcoin is a system of an electronic payment established on <a href="/bitcoin-miner-antminer-s9/">mathematical proof</a> by a software developer named Satoshi Nakamoto. The concept was to create a currency which is not dependent of any authority centrally as well as transferable instantly through online with only minimal transaction fees. </p>

<h2>Who prints it?</h2>

<p><center><img src="/images/what-is-bitcoin.jpg" alt="what is bitcoin"/></center></p>

<p>No one can. This currency is not printed physically under the shadows of a central bank, not accountable to the population and generating its own rules. The banks simply can make money to mask off the national debt, therefore devaluing their currency.</p>

<p>Alternatively, bitcoin is made digitally by the people in a community where anybody can readily join. Bitcoins are ‘mined’ by the use of a computing power inside a distributed network. </p>

<p>This network also allows transactions to process made by this <a href="/hardware/">virtual currency</a>, using bitcoin as their own payment network.</p> 

<h2>So you can’t produce unlimited bitcoins?</h2>

<p>Yes you can’t.  As the bitcoin protocol (the guidelines that makes bitcoin work) said, there can only be a total of twenty-one million bitcoin that the miners will ever create. Nonetheless, these bitcoins can be further divided into its smallest divisible amount which is a hundred-millionth in each bitcoin and is called “Satoshi”, named after its founder.</p>

<h2>What is bitcoin primarily based on?</h2>

<p>The usual currency is typically based on silver or gold. But apparently, if you give over a dollar in a bank, they are supposed to give you some gold back (this doesn’t work in real life though). Bitcoin is primarily based on mathematics and not on gold. </p>

<p>People around the world are utilizing software programs that employ a mathematical formula in order to create bitcoins. This mathematical formula is available for free so anyone can readily check it. </p>

<p>The software is also free source which means that it is readily available for anyone to look at to check if it does what it’s supposed to.</p>

<h2>What are its features?</h2>

<p>Bitcoin has a lot of valuable features making it unique from the conventional currencies.</p>

<strong>1.	It is decentralized</strong>

<p>One central authority can never control the <a href="/usb-bitcoin-miner/">bitcoin network</a>. Every machine comprises a part of this network and it works together; the bitcoin miner machine and transaction processor machine. So hypothetically, not even one central authority can be able to control the monetary policy which can cause devastation or can simply choose to pull out people’s bitcoin from them, what happened with Cyprus last early 2013 when the Central European Bank decided to do it to them. And when one part of the Bitcoin network suddenly goes offline, the money will keep on flowing.</p>

<strong>2.	The set-up is easy</strong>

<p>Ordinary banks make you pay some dues just to open a financial balance. Setting up shipper represents instalment is another Kafkaesque undertaking, assailed by administration. Nonetheless, you can set up a bitcoin address in seconds, no inquiries asked, and without any charges payable.</p>

<strong>3.	It is anonymous</strong>

<p>Indeed, sort of. Clients can hold different bitcoin locations, and they aren't connected to names, addresses, or other specifically recognizing data. In any case…</p>

<strong>4.	It is entirely transparent</strong>

<p>… bitcoin stores points of interest of each and every exchange that at any point occurred in the system in a tremendous rendition of a general record, called the blockchain. The blockchain tells all. </p>

<p>In the event that you have an openly utilized bitcoin address, anybody can tell what number of bitcoins are put away at that address. They simply don't have the foggiest idea about that it's yours. </p>

<p>There are measures that individuals can take to make their exercises more hazy on the bitcoin arrange, however, for example, not utilizing the same bitcoin addresses reliably, and not exchanging bunches of bitcoin to a solitary address.</p>

<strong>5.	Has very small transaction fees</strong>

<p>Not like the bank that may charge you as much as £10 for a fee for <a href="/bitcoin-miner-SP20-jackson/">transfers internationally</a>, Bitcoin does not. </p>

<strong>6.	It is fast</strong>

<p>As long as the network already processed the payment, the recipient can readily receive in a few minutes the money that was sent from anywhere. </p>

<strong>7.	It’s not repudiable</strong>

<p>At the point when your bitcoins are sent, there's no getting them back, unless the beneficiary returns them to you. They're gone until the end of time. </p>

<p>Along these lines, bitcoin has a great deal taking the plunge, in principle. Be that as it may, how can it work, by and by? Perused more to discover how bitcoins are mined, what happens when a bitcoin exchange happens, and how the <a href="/software/">system monitors everything</a>.</p>
