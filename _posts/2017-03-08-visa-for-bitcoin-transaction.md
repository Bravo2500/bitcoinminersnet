<p><a href="/software/">Core supporters and Blockstream</a> have been working on a “fee market” with all the time have full blocks for few years already. A lot of people also complaining about the being unstable of Bitcoin with no full blocks, where they ignored that it was not full for the past eight years of Bitcoin’s life.</p>

<p>Most of the Bitcoin users nowadays knows that <a href="/cloud/">Bitcoin network</a> is already over flowing. Numbers of business were putting extra hours and efforts trying to solve issues with their customer’s requests to resolve the issues on their transactions where it wasn’t been confirmed. The confirmation time frame of last year’s transactions is between ten minutes to almost two hours.</p>

<p>It was a surprise from my end to learn that people today can now use their credit cards in order to confirm their Bitcoin transaction.</p>

<p>This is not actually the main concept of Bitcoin technology and I was shocked on what I just discovered on this bad things to fall into places and yes we should be thankful to Blockstream and Core for their unfortunate and <a href="/pools/">misleading economic policies</a>.</p>

<h2>The Solution Is Not Segwit</h2>

<p>It is important to remember that this Core team was the one implementing this kind of fee market for years already. Now it’s on the path and they have it, and its a wreck just like me saying and the other guys who are loyal to the real concept of Bitcoin. When Friendster and Myspace soar high on their peak of being famous thinking that there’s nothing can beat them, now Facebook slap on their faces.</p>

<p>The new <a href="/what-is-bitcoin/">Core developers</a> actually thought that they can just replace Bitcoin that easily and if Bitcoin doesn’t prosper and in line with customers needs, it will be change to something else, and it will be the new Core developer’s mistake for not giving a way every attempt on scaling and instead making of awful economic policies.</p>

<p>Bitcoin should be on the same concept from the beginning and we are encouraging the Core developers to make the path wider not on changing the material on making path. Mistakes before with <a href="/what-is-bitcoin-mining/">Friendster and Myspace</a> is that they are competing on the new comer and not focusing on making ways on how it can attract more users. </p>
